# SilksongLauncher.Launcher

The app. An Android library module, built into an AAR and packaged into the
APK by `tools/depot-to-apk/build.sh`.

It is not a menu in front of the game — it is what builds the game. On first
run it fetches Unity's toolchain, signs in to Steam, downloads the user's own
depot, converts the game's assemblies to C++, compiles them with clang, and
assembles the player image, all on the device.

## Building

Normally not directly — `make dev` builds this and packages it in one step.
On its own:

```bash
cd src/SilksongLauncher.Launcher
java -classpath "<player-module>/Tools/gradle/lib/gradle-launcher-8.11.jar" \
     org.gradle.launcher.GradleMain :app:assembleRelease :app:collectRuntimeDeps
```

No Gradle wrapper is checked in; the Android player module carries Gradle
8.11, which is what the build uses. `collectRuntimeDeps` materialises the
runtime classpath so the packaging step can dex it.

## Notes

- **The APK contains no Unity classes.** This module compiles against
  `classes.jar` as a library only; `UnityDex` dexes it on the device and
  injects the result into the app's class loader from
  `SilksongApp.attachBaseContext`, before any activity is loaded.
- **targetSdk 28 is load-bearing.** `untrusted_app_27` is the only SELinux
  domain that permits `execute_no_trans` on app data, which is what lets the
  fetched clang and .NET run at all.
- **The patches are C# source**, compiled on the device against the depot's
  own assemblies, which is what gives them typed access to the game's classes.
