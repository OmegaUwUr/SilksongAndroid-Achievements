// BuildReset — throw away the ported game, keep everything expensive.
//
// A port can end up wrong in ways nothing detects: a build interrupted at the
// wrong moment, a patch that changed under a stamp, an engine that loads and
// then misbehaves. The answer was to uninstall the app, which also threw away
// the depot -- around 8 GB fetched from Steam -- and the player's saves. That
// is a bad trade for "try building it again".
//
// So this deletes what the build PRODUCED and nothing that was DOWNLOADED:
//
//   gone    build/          the on-device build: generated C++, objects,
//                           libil2cpp.so, the player image, and the stamps
//                           that say those are current
//           pkg/            the packaged player the engine actually loads
//           unity-dex/      the player's Java classes, dexed; seconds to redo
//           aa              the symlink to the content tree, remade every run
//           staging/        transient, and only ever holds a partial copy
//           depot-staging/
//           the game's settings   volumes, language, brightness, resolution,
//                           frame cap -- and the marker that says the
//                           first-run resolution has been decided
//           the launcher's settings
//           the remembered depot folder   the PATH ONLY. See clear() for why.
//
//   kept    depot/          the game, ~8 GB, and the user's own property
//           the game's files wherever the user put them, untouched
//           unity/          Unity's Android player module, ~640 MB
//           toolchain/      clang and .NET, several hundred MB
//           default/        THE SAVES
//           the Steam sign-in
//
// The kept list is the point. Everything in it is either expensive to fetch
// again or impossible to replace, and none of it is what a bad port is made
// of -- the depot is verified against Steam's manifest, and the toolchain
// against a marker written only after a real compile and link succeeded.
//
// The sign-in is kept for the same reason: it is a QR scan on a phone, it has
// nothing to do with how the game was built, and losing it is a worse
// interruption than the one being fixed. It also lives in its own file, is
// encrypted with a key from the Android Keystore, and is the only thing here
// that cannot be reconstructed from what is on disk.
//
// Anything not named here is left alone. Directories from older layouts of
// this app are still on some devices, and deleting a directory because it is
// unfamiliar is how a feature meant to save a download costs one.
