// DepotFetcher — downloads the game from the user's own Steam account.
//
// Nothing game-derived ships in the APK, so the content has to come from the
// person running it, out of the library they already own. That is what this
// does: it signs in with the refresh token QR sign-in produced, and pulls the
// depot straight from Steam's CDN onto the device.
//
// The download itself is JavaSteam's, not a port of one. It is the same
// library the QR sign-in already uses, which means one Steam stack, one
// connection, and no handing tokens to a second process to do the work.
//
// (There is an older C# depot downloader in src/SilksongLauncher/Steam/ built
// on SteamKit2. It still works, but using it here would mean running .NET to
// download and re-implementing sign-in on that side to get a session it could
// use. This route needs neither.)
