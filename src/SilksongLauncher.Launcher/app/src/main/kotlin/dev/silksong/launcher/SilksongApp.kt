// SilksongApp — custom Application class for the Silksong APK.

// Runs ONCE PER PROCESS at process startup, before any Activity is created.

    // The APK links against com.unity3d.player.* and ships none of it: the
    // player classes are dexed on the device out of the module the app
    // downloads. GameActivity's superclass is one of the types that resolves
    // from there, so the dex has to be in the class loader before the
    // framework instantiates the activity. attachBaseContext is the first
    // point in the process where that is possible.

        // to a file from here on, which is what makes it survivable enough to
        // be worth asking a user for.
        LauncherLog.attach(this)

        // Before anything else, and in every process: JavaSteam's crypto
        // registers itself the first time it is touched, and on Android it
        // registers the wrong thing unless this has run first. See SteamCrypto.
