# Notices

This project is MIT-licensed (see `LICENSE`). The APK it produces also
redistributes third-party components, listed below with their licences.

## What the APK does not contain

Stated first because it is the point of the whole design:

* **No Unity engine code.** The APK links against `com.unity3d.player.*` without
  containing it — Unity's `classes.jar` is a compile-time `--lib` only, and the
  classes it references are dexed on the device and injected into the app's
  class loader at process start. `apkanalyzer dex packages --defined-only`
  reports **zero** classes defined in the `com.unity3d` package.
* **No game code, art or audio.** Silksong is © Team Cherry. Nothing of the
  game travels in the APK; it is downloaded from the user's own Steam depot, on
  their own device, with their own account.
* **No Unity binaries.** `libunity.so`, `libmain.so` and `libil2cpp.so` are
  fetched or built on the device.

## A note on `classdata.tpk`

`assets/ondevice/bundle-surgery/classdata.tpk` is a type-package database that
AssetsTools.NET uses to deserialise Unity asset bundles whose type trees have
been stripped, as Silksong's are. It describes Unity's **serialisation layouts**
— class identifiers, field names and their types — and contains no Unity code,
no Unity assemblies and no game data. It is redistributed from the
AssetsTools.NET ecosystem under the MIT licence.

It is included because parsing a type-tree-stripped bundle is impossible
without it, and it is the same kind of artefact as a file-format description.

## Source references and separately downloaded tools

See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the original Android project, achievement-viewer
contributors, shader-format and Steam compatibility references, and the
Termux, LLVM, Roslyn, Unity, and other tools fetched during on-device setup.
That file distinguishes these roles from components bundled in the APK.
