// IntroSkipper — optionally skips Silksong's startup intro sequence
// (the studio logos + opening quote) and drops straight into loading
// the main menu, controlled by a launcher Settings toggle.
//
// Why a runtime hook (and not a source patch):
//
//   The port deliberately doesn't patch the game's own code — it only ADDS
//   MonoBehaviours (ResolutionConfigurator, PerfOverlay, AnimatorRebindFix, …).
//   This stays in keeping with that: a small bootstrapped behaviour that drives
//   the game's OWN animator instead of editing StartManager.
//
// How the intro works (StartManager.Start, the startup coroutine):
//
//   StartManager kicks off the core-manager load + Menu_Title scene
//   load via a callback (DoActionAfterAllLoadsComplete sets
//   `startedLoadingMenu`), THEN — gated by a hardcoded
//   `showIntroSequence = true` — plays `startManagerAnimator`:
//     SetBool("WillShowQuote", true); SetTrigger("Start");
//     while (anim state shortNameHash != hash("LoadingIcon")) yield;
//   i.e. it just waits for the animator to reach the "LoadingIcon"
//   state (logos → quote → loading-icon) before activating the menu.
//   Crucially the actual menu LOAD is independent of this animation —
//   it's driven by the load callback, not by any animation event — so
//   short-circuiting the animator to "LoadingIcon" is safe: only the
//   wait loop is affected; the menu still loads and activates normally.
//
// What we do:
//
//   While StartManager is alive (skip enabled), force its animator
//   straight to the "LoadingIcon" state every frame. That makes
//   StartManager's wait loop exit immediately, skipping the logos +
//   quote (and their animation/audio events, since those states never
//   play). A speed bump is set as a SAFETY NET only — if Play() can't
//   land the state directly on some animator layout, the natural
//   transitions still fast-forward to "LoadingIcon" within a fraction
//   of a second rather than hanging.
//
//   Caveat (documented in the launcher Settings subtitle): the
//   loading / save-icon screen — the "LoadingIcon" state — still shows
//   briefly while the menu finishes loading. Only the logos + quote
//   cutscene is skipped, not the unavoidable load wait.
//
//   Reads the `skip_intro` flag from the shared `launcher_settings`
//   SharedPreferences via JNI, the same cross-process pattern as
//   ResolutionConfigurator / PerfOverlay (the launcher `:launcher`
//   process writes it; the game process reads it).
