// ResolutionConfigurator — the frame cap, and a sensible starting resolution.
//
// ── the resolution ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This used to be a launcher setting: pick 720p/900p/1080p/native in Settings,
// and every boot would force it with Screen.SetResolution. That is gone, and
// the reason it could go is worth writing down, because it was not obvious.
//
// Unity persists the resolution ON ANDROID. After a Screen.SetResolution the
// player prefs carry
//
//     Screenmanager Resolution Width  = 1280
//     Screenmanager Resolution Height = 720
//     Screenmanager Fullscreen mode   = 1
//
// and the engine restores them on the next launch. So there is nothing to
// re-apply: forcing it every boot was not making it stick, it was overwriting
// whatever the player had chosen since.
//
// What is left is a default. 720p, applied exactly once, on a device that has
// never run this before -- roughly half the pixels of a 1080p panel, which is
// most of a battery saving on art that tolerates the downscale. After that the
// game owns it, including through its own resolution menu, and nothing here
// touches it again.
//
// Nothing is clamped any more either. The old code refused to set anything at
// or above the panel's short dimension, which meant the highest modes were
// unreachable by design; the panel's own modes are exactly what the game's
// menu offers, and they should work.

    /**
     * The frame cap, held rather than set, and vsync held off with it.
     *
     * The game stores its cap in PlayerPrefs as VidTFR and offers four values:
     * -1 ("off"), 30, 60 and 120, plus the panel's own rate when that exceeds
     * 120. -1 means "uncapped" on a desktop, but Unity reads a negative target
     * as its mobile default of 30, so the option meant to remove the limit is
     * the one that imposes the worst one.
     *
     * The other half is VSync, and it is the larger one. The game's VSync
     * option does not merely enable vsync -- MenuSetting.UpdateSetting, case
     * VSync, does this when it is switched on:
     *
     *     Platform.Current.VSyncCount = 1;
     *     Application.targetFrameRate = -1;
     *     UIManager.instance.DisableFrameCapSetting();
     *
     * So turning vsync on sets the same -1 sentinel, and disables the frame cap
     * control so it cannot be set back. On Android that is a request for 30 fps
     * whatever the cap says -- and vsync is ON by default, both in
     * GameSettings (LoadInt("VidVSync", ref vSync, 1)) and in the project's own
     * QualitySettings.asset (vSyncCount: 1).
     *
     * There is no vsync-on path that reaches 120 here, because Unity ignores
     * targetFrameRate entirely while vSyncCount is non-zero and the game only
     * ever pairs vsync with -1. Holding vsync off and driving the rate from
     * targetFrameRate is the only arrangement in which the cap means anything,
     * which is why this does not try to preserve a vsync choice.
     *
     * THREE approaches failed before this one. Setting targetFrameRate once at
     * startup loses, because the game re-applies its own settings from menu
     * code. Writing VidTFR instead loses too: measured on the device, the patch
     * logged "frame cap -1 -> 120" every launch and the prefs file still read
     * -1 afterwards, because the game writes its in-memory value back after
     * ours. So both values are GUARDED instead -- see FrameCapHolder, which
     * needs no stored state and no timer to do it. The prefs are still written,
     * because it costs nothing and makes the menu agree when it is read fresh.
     *
     * A deliberate 30 or 60 is still respected -- that is a real choice about
     * battery. Only the sentinel is corrected.

/**
 * Puts the resolutions the player actually wants into the game's own menu.
 *
 * Silksong builds its resolution list from Screen.resolutions
 * (MenuResolutionSetting.RefreshAvailableResolutions). On Android that array
 * describes the panel as it is mounted rather than as it is held -- one entry,
 * 1080x1920, portrait -- so the menu offers a single unusable option. The one
 * thing that saves it is a fallback in RefreshCurrentIndex: a current
 * resolution missing from the list gets prepended. That is why the menu showed
 * exactly two entries, whichever resolution happened to be running plus the
 * portrait one, and why choosing 1080p made 720p disappear.
 *
 * So the list is replaced with the sizes this panel can sensibly render: its
 * native landscape mode, then 900 and 720, each keeping the panel's aspect
 * ratio. Everything downstream is the game's own code and needs no help --
 * PushUpdateOptionList formats the labels, ApplySettings indexes the same array
 * we wrote, and Unity persists the result.
 *
 * The array is private, so it is set by reflection. The alternative was to
 * rewrite the menu, and this is the smaller lie: one field, restored to the
 * shape the game already expects, with every method that reads it left alone.
 * It is re-applied whenever the pane is opened, because RefreshControls runs on
 * enable and overwrites it -- and it fails silently, leaving the game's own
 * behaviour, if the field ever stops being there.
 *
 * Entries carry the CURRENT refresh rate, so the running resolution matches one
 * of them exactly (Resolution.Equals compares the rate too). Without that,
 * RefreshCurrentIndex would decide the current mode is missing and prepend a
 * near-duplicate of a row already on screen.

/**
 * Turns a portrait resolution back into the landscape one the player meant.
 *
 * Android reports this hardware the way it is mounted, not the way it is held:
 * Screen.resolutions on the Thor contains 1080x1920, portrait. Silksong's own
 * video options build their list straight from that array
 * (MenuResolutionSetting.RefreshAvailableResolutions), so the menu offers
 * "1080 x 1920" and there is no 1920x1080 in it at all. Choosing it hands
 * Screen.SetResolution a portrait target for a game that only runs landscape.
 *
 * The full-resolution option therefore could not be reached from the menu --
 * which is what the launcher's old "Native" setting used to provide, by
 * setting nothing at all and letting Unity keep the panel's real landscape
 * mode.
 *
 * So the resolution is transposed after the fact rather than the menu being
 * rewritten. The game owns that list and rebuilds it whenever the pane opens;
 * fighting it there would mean reaching into a private array through
 * reflection and losing to the next refresh. Watching the outcome instead is
 * both smaller and harder to get wrong: a portrait render target is always
 * wrong here, whoever asked for it.
 *
 * The last correction is remembered so that a device which genuinely refuses
 * to leave portrait is asked exactly once rather than every tick.

 * Keeps vsync off and the frame cap off the broken sentinel.
 *
 * Neither value can be set once and left. The game re-applies both from menu
 * code (MenuSetting.UpdateSetting), from Platform.SetTargetFrameRate, and from
 * Platform.RestoreFrameRate after a video; QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel also
 * resets vSyncCount to the project default, which is 1. None of those is
 * reachable from here -- the patches are an additional assembly compiled
 * against the game, not a rewrite of it -- so there is nothing to subscribe to
 * and the values have to be guarded rather than assigned.
 *
 * The guard is two engine property reads per frame and nothing else. There is
 * deliberately no timer and no PlayerPrefs lookup: an earlier version polled
 * the pref every three seconds, which was both more expensive per check and
 * wrong, because it read the stored cap to decide whether to act and our own
 * startup code had just written a positive value into it -- so it returned
 * early forever and never corrected anything.
 *
 * The test that works needs no stored state at all. The game applies the
 * player's chosen cap by assigning Application.targetFrameRate directly, so a
 * positive value already IS their choice, whatever it is, and is left alone. A
 * value at or below zero can only be the "off" sentinel, which Unity reads on
 * Android as 30. Replacing just that is the whole job, and it happens within a
 * frame rather than within three seconds.
