# Fetch everything the build needs that is not ours and not the user's game.
#
# The builder ships none of this. Unity's engine, toolchain and packages are
# Unity's to distribute, so the device gets them from Unity, and the phone's
# owner obtains them the same way any Unity developer does. Nothing here is
# redistributed by us, and nothing here is game-derived -- the game comes from
# the user's own Steam depot and never leaves their device.
#
# What is fetched, and why it cannot simply be committed:
#
#   Unity editor        il2cpp (the IL->C++ converter and the libil2cpp runtime
#                       sources) and the unityaot BCL. Only ~155 MB is kept.
#                       The archive is a single xz block, so it cannot be
#                       seeked into -- but tar is sequential and Unity packs
#                       both wanted trees near the front, so a 640 MiB prefix
#                       of the 4.29 GB archive is streamed and the rest is
#                       never asked for.
#
#   Android module      libunity.so, libmain.so, classes.jar, baselib.a, the
#                       engine's built-in resources and the stock managed
#                       assemblies. For this Unity version the module is
#                       published only as a macOS .pkg, which is a xar archive
#                       wrapping a cpio payload -- bsdtar reads both.
#
#   Unity packages      com.unity.inputsystem. The depot's copy is the desktop
#                       build, with the Android backend compiled out, so the
#                       game cannot see a gamepad. Packages ship as SOURCE, so
#                       this is compiled on device (see compile-packages.sh).
#                       Its licence, the Unity Companion License, states that
#                       use is acceptance, so there is nothing to click.
#
#   JDK + d8            Unity's classes.jar is Java bytecode and the built APK
#                       needs it as dex, so a dexer has to run here. d8 is an
#                       ordinary Java program; the JDK is Termux's.
#
# Everything lands under $ROOT and is skipped if already present, so an
# interrupted first run is resumed by running this again.
